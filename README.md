# My Portfolio

Started off as a draft, ended up as my website. ReactJS with LESS.

# Broken Stuff

- Worky component, when rendering the project section, breaks the overlay text.
- Projects section doesn't have reactivity anymore.

# TO-DO

- Add Styled-Components to help relieve the weight of broken styling?
- Publications section?

- Project Section Specific:
  - Refactor project section to map an array that is passed to the props.
  - Mobile-friendly option for the overlay text.
  - New overlay images in the project section - maybe a new layout entirely? Feels forced.
  - Maybe clicking a picture will route you to a new page that displays the information, rather than having the overlay itself do it. A little extra work but it would come out a little better.
