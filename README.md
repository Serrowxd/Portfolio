# Legacy 2019 Portfolio

One of my first real attempts at an online presence for me. Everything below is the original readme.

This is being revamped as part of my 2025 portfolio revamp, it will be deployed and displayed in my new portfolio project section as an item of rememberance.

---

Started off as a draft, ended up as my website. ReactJS with LESS.

# Broken Stuff

- Worky component, when rendering the project section, breaks the overlay text. [NO LONGER USED]

- Projects section doesn't have reactivity anymore. [FIXED]

# TO-DO

- Refactor all the media breakpoints into LESS mixins.
- Create a "holder" for all the media breakpoints, right now they are scattered and hard to manage.

# WORKING

- Publications section
- Photography section

- Project Section Specific:

  - Refactor project section to map an array that is passed to the props.
  - Mobile-friendly option for the overlay text.
  - New overlay images in the project section - maybe a new layout entirely? Feels forced.
  - Maybe clicking a picture will route you to a new page that displays the information, rather than having the overlay itself do it. A little extra work but it would come out a little better.

- Navigation:

  - Probably need to add an <active> tag so that users will know which page they are on.

- Social:
  - Going to remove this section and relist it under my About, then probably replace it with a PDF of my portfolio.
