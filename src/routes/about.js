            I'm a 23 year old programmer based out of Houston, Texas. I'm very
            analytical, optimistic, and a massive perfectionist. My primary
            focus is to become a well-rounded Engineer both in Web Design and
            Software Develeopment. If I could summarize myself into a paragraph,
            it would go something like this;
            <p>
              <code>
                I'm an optimistic perfectionist with a keen sense of
                misdirection, backed with an incredible amount of luck, a group
                of very patient and caring friends (Jared, Austin, Randall,
                Felix, Shen), and an unbreakable desire to become the absolute
                best at what I do - no matter the cost. I'm a firm believer in
                constant progression, so I'm always setting a higher marker for
                myself to achieve.

            I've got a pretty heavy background in computers and gaming, starting
            from when I was very young (2-3 years old). While they may not mean
            a lot in the real world, I have numerable gaming achievements that
            I'm incredibly proud of;

            Outside of Code, I have an unhealthy obsession with
            Creative/Fictional Writing, Dungeons & Dragons, Art, Photography,
            Fan-Fiction, Music, and Creative Design. I've been a bookworm since
            the 3rd grade, my nose always firmly planted in a novel. I am in the
            process of publishing my own book, name and release date are
            currently <strong>TBD</strong>. Creative Writing (poetry included)
            is something I'm incredibly passionate about.
